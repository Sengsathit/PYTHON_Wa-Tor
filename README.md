## Description
The Wa-Tor simulation is a predator-prey dynamics model set in an aquatic environment. It simulates interactions between fish (prey) and sharks (predators) in an ocean represented by a toroidal grid.

## Features
- **Toroidal environment:** The top of the grid is connected to the bottom, and the left side is connected to the right side, creating a borderless environment.
- **Fish behavior:** Fish move randomly and reproduce at a certain frequency.
- **Shark behavior:** Sharks move, eat fish to survive, and also reproduce.

## Technologies used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries/Frameworks: Tkinter

## Installation and usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sengsathit/PYTHON_Wa-Tor.git
